# Portfolio

## What is a Portfolio?

Professional portfolios are central hubs for an indivduals works in whatever field they're working/attempting to work in. For web developers (that's you), this typically takes the shape of a website.

## What should it include?
- Examples of work that you've done. These, ideally, should be comprehensive projects that touch on all aspects of full stack web development. 
- Profile of you as a professional individual. There's no need to tell your life story, or share embarassing/inappropriate facts or anecdoes, but let your personality shine through your portfolio at least a little bit. 
- While it's not recommended that you share your personal tik tok, or instagram, or whatever, you should share at least a few of your socials:
  - LinkedIn - it's like professional facebook. You don't need to be super active on LinkedIn, or one of those irritating LinkedInfluencers, but you should include a link to your page. 
  - Github - this is your bread and butter for showing what you've done. Even if most repositories you've worked on have been private, you can still publicize your commit history. Your commit history shows dedication and committment to programming. 

## How should you build the portfolio itself?

It depends to an extent. For now, simply create a React app. In the future, if you have found that front end development is not for you, you can always use some kind of template engine site. Things like Wordpress, Wix, etc., are all commonly used as portfolio sites. But if you are working as a front end developer, relying on somebody else's tools to create your front end... doesn't look good.

## What should be done this week?

For this week's progress check, your portfolio should at least contain:
- A basic layout with some template info. Feel free to use the lorem feature for some of it (particularly when laying out where the project info will be). 
- A photo of you (or at least a placeholder photo)
- An about me section where you write some info about you
