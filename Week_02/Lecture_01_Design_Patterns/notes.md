# Design Patterns
A design pattern is a generally accepted solution to a common problem. 

Within the realm of programming, design patterns are accepted and reusable solutions to common problems within a given context in the design of an application. Within programming, design patterns are typically not locked to any one language/framework/library/etc.. 

Software design patterns were originally inspired by architectural design patterns. 

## Why do we use Design Patterns?
Why spend so much time re-solving the same problem when there may be a commonly accepted solution to that problem? Why build something from the ground up when we already know of something that works (in short, if it ain't broke, don't fix it).
